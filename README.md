# NumRepper
A converter for number representations.
I was inspired to create this number representation converter by the problem of time efficiency in my computer engineering class, as well as the experience of a blackout while preparing for a test, meaning that I lost access to online converters.
Computer engineers must work with and convert between different number representations, mainly decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers.
This Python program helped dramatically speed up my conversions, and I hope it will serve you the same way!

In order to run this converter, download only the main file and run it (Python 3.9 recommended). It's as simple as that!
