# NumRepper
A converter for number representations.
I was inspired to create this number representation converter by the problem of time efficiency in my computer engineering class.
Computer engineers must work with and convert between different number representations, mainly decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers.
This Python program helped dramatically speed up my conversions, and I hope it will serve you the same way :)
